    <h3 id=1>Isaac Albéniz.</h3>
    <p>Isaac Manuel Francisco Albéniz y Pascual (Camprodón, Gerona, May 29, 1860-Cambo-les-Bains, May 18, 1909) was a famous Spanish composer and pianist, a disciple of Felipe Pedrell. Thanks to the help of William Morphy, the Count of Morphy, composer and patron of the arts, he obtained a pension to train at the Brussels Conservatory in 1876, and finished his studies in 1879.

        Being a virtuoso piano composer, Isaac Albéniz also composed music for other instruments. He dedicated more than a decade of his almost forty-nine years of life to writing themes for the theater —such as, for example, his most successful operatic work, Pepita Jiménez— he also dedicated himself to performing concerts or recording his opera Merlín. During his career he wrote songs—more than two dozen—as well as various orchestral and chamber themes.
        
        Isaac Albéniz's personal collection is preserved in the Library of Catalonia and in the Music Museum of Barcelona, ​​which keeps the donation offered by the composer's granddaughter (includes biographical documentation, original manuscript copies and personal objects). There is an "Albéniz Foundation", with offices in Madrid and Santander, currently chaired by Paloma O'Shea.</p>
