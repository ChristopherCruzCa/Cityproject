    <h3 id=1>War history.</h3>
    <p>The town has its origins in the monastery of San Pedro (Sant Pere) and in the market granted by Ramón Berenguer III in 1118. Inside the monastery, the parish church of Santa María was replaced by the current Gothic building in the 14th century. Camprodón reached the rank of royal town and head of the veguería de Camprodón around the year 1252, and was under the jurisdiction of the abbot, but from 1286 to 1301, it belonged to the Viscount of Castellnou. Louis XI of France looted and burned Camprodon in 1470 during the war against John II of Aragon. It was also occupied by France during the Franco-Spanish War (1654-1658). And again it was taken by the French (the Duke of Noailles) in 1689 in the wars of Charles II against Louis XIV. The Duke of Villahermosa del Río recovered the population and blew up the deteriorated castle. Also during the Great War, in 1794, the French general Dagobert took it and set it on fire. Camprodón also suffered greatly during the first and third Carlist wars in the 19th century.</p>

    <h3 id=2>Economy.</h3>
    <p>Already in the 20th century, Camprodón began a notable economic and social recovery, which led to greater stability, despite recessions such as the Civil War, and also thanks, in part, to the wave of immigration. The first summer colony of Camprodón was centered on the Paseo de la Fuente Nueva, at the end of which today we can find a bust of Dr. Robert, mayor of Barcelona and pioneer of the summer colony at the time. Later, the Maristany promenade became the new summer resort, where the Catalan bourgeoisie built large houses along the promenade, also contributing to the creation, at later times, of the tennis club and the golf club (promoted among others by Antonio García-Nieto father and son and Narciso de Prat). For a short period of time, one of the mansions that were built (El Robredal) became the seat of the Government of the Second Republic and the residence of its president, Juan Negrín.</p>

    <h3 id=3>Territory.</h3>
    <p>In 1969 and 1965, respectively, it incorporated Baget and Freixanet. Baget, also known as San Cristóbal de Baget, included the towns of Bestracá, Rocabruna and Salarsá. Freixanet included Bolós, Caballera and Greixenturre. The Maristany urbanization, which belonged to Llanás but formed a continuum with Camprodón, was also annexed.

        On April 18, 1984, the municipality changed its official name: it went from Camprodón to Camprodon.</p>
