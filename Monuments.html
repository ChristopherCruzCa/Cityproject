    <h3 id=2>Monestir de Sant Pere.</h3>
    <p>The church is the only thing that remains of the old monastery. It currently hosts exhibitions and is well worth a visit. It is also in a very careful environment.
        It should be noted that the nearby square has been landscaped since the beginning of the 20th century by a star of his time, Forestier. Even today it exudes class and quality in its design.</p>

    <h3 id=3>Castillo de Rocabruna.</h3>
    <p>The name of the castle comes from the color of the ground, the surrounding stones and those that are part of the walls, which is very blackened or brown. Access to the castle is quite difficult, since the hill is completely surrounded by forest, it is only possible to get there through a half-abandoned path that climbs from the base of the mountain, and passes through the houses of the Villa and Ca l'Arnet. Below the mountain runs the GR-11 path, in its section Molló - Beget. The views are much more interesting than the castle. From there you can see part of the Camprodon Valley, all the forests towards Beget, which is a medieval architectural gem.</p>
    <p>Many legends are told around the castle. One says that in Arab times, when Rocabruna was besieged, its inhabitants dug a long mine to go down to the river to fetch water. It is the legend of the famine site.

        It is also said that there is a buried treasure in the castle. The belief is so firm that once lightning struck and the neighbors went with the hope that the demolition of a canvas of the interior wall made by lightning would have exposed the famous treasure to the outside.
        
        In Tuta de Maimona, under the cliff of Coll de la Mola in front of La Guardiola, on windy days, it is said that goblins go out to visit those peaks wrapped in a large sheet and that in the house that they were caught they would never clothes would be missing.</p>
